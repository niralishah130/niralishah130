# 💡 Product and TPM: The Similarities and The Synergies

## ✈️ Setting off on my P&D journey 

When I heard about P&D plans during my onboarding at GitHub, I was super excited about the opportunity to discover and make investments in my personal growth. But... I had no idea where the hell to start 😆 . In one of my many spiraling conversations with @mrry550, she asked me what I liked. It seemed like such a simple question, but I was lost for words. I embarrassingly explained my bemusement and she responded with something I won't forget - 

> "Listen to yourself."

> "After a call, do you feel excited? Do you feel like you just want it to be over with? What was the call about? What did you discuss in the call?"

> "Something in one of those good calls might be something you like."

Just this past week, I had the privilege of going to the Product Industry Conference in Cleveland. After taking account of my calendar and which conversations, and which concepts within those conversations piqued my interest, I arrived at the crossroads of Product. Product vision and strategy, entering new markets, tradeoffs and decision-making, competitive landscapes, and go-to-market launches, were just a few of the topics that had made the short list. So, a P&D plan that mapped to Product careers and curriculum was the next step! 🏃

## 🔄 Product ❤️ TPM  

One of the biggest things I learned about Product is how akin it is in profession and nature to Technical Program Management. It made sense why I loved my job as TPM so much 😁.
