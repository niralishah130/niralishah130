## Intro
Hi there 👋🏼 - I'm Nirali Shah. After graduating from college a few years ago studying CS and Philosophy, I turned my love for logic into a career in Technical Program Management at Microsoft, and now GitHub, bringing logic in the form of structured plans and established processes to my programs. 

Above all, my purpose is helping others find their own purposes. On the job, that's through giving meaning to products and solutions, not on the job, that's through giving meaning to life - throughout both, giving meaning to the people I have the opportunity of connecting with (from my peers to my end users to my readers). 

Some parts of my career I want to explore further:
💡 Product strategy and vision
🗞️ Product positioning and messaging

My favorite novel:
📘 The Book Thief

My favorite sports teams:
🏈 Baltimore Ravens
🧡 UVA Basketball

Some of my other favorite things:
🥘 I love cooking (veg!)
☮️ Spirituality, religion, and philosophy get my mind going
🚶 I love hiking, walking, being outside
🌆 I love sunsets 🏖️ The beach is my happy place

A fun fact:
I wrote a [book](https://the-everyday-gita.squarespace.com/) 🌞! 
I love to write 🖋️. Check out my [blog](https://the-everyday-gita.squarespace.com/the-blog).
